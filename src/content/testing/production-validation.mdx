# Testing in Production: The Taboo

## The Lie of "Staging"
"It worked in Staging" is the epitaph of every SRE.
**Staging is not Production.**
-   It doesn't have the data volume.
-   It doesn't have the chaotic traffic patterns.
-   It doesn't have that one weird load balancer config from 2019.

## Safe Testing in Prod
You don't just "deploy and pray". You use:
1.  **Canary Deploys:** Roll out to 1% of users. Measure error rate.
2.  **Feature Flags:** Turn it on for "internal users" first.
3.  **Synthetic Transaction Monitoring:** A bot that buys an item every 5 minutes to verify the site is up.

## The New QA Mindset
**Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) > Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).**
-   You cannot prevent 100% of bugs.
-   But you *can* detect and revert them in 30 seconds.
-   **Observability is Testing.**
