# The Test Pyramid vs The Ice Cream Cone

## The Ideal (The Pyramid)
Proposed by tracking Mike Cohn.
-   **70% Unit Tests:** Fast (ms). Deterministic. Cheap.
-   **20% Integration:** Test db/api boundaries. Slower (s).
-   **10% E2E (UI):** Test user flows. Slow (m). Flaky. Expensive.

## The Reality (The Ice Cream Cone)
Most organizations have:
-   **0% Unit:** "Too hard to mock things."
-   **10% Integration:** "We don't have environments."
-   **90% E2E (Selenium/Cypress):** "Just record what the user does."

## Why The Cone Kills Velocity
1.  **Flakiness:** E2E tests fail 10% of the time due to network bloops, not bugs.
2.  **Duration:** A suite of 500 Selenium tests takes 4 hours. Developers stop running them.
3.  **Debugging:** When an E2E test fails, you know "It didn't click the button," but you don't know *why*.

## The Fix: Invert the Pyramid
**Delete your E2E tests.**
-   Radical? Yes.
-   If a test is flaky, it provides **negative value**. It erodes trust.
-   Replace 1 E2E test with 20 Unit tests and 2 Integration tests.
