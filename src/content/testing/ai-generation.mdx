# AI Test Generation: The Infinite Monkey Theorem

## The Pitch
"Use our AI to scan your website and generate 10,000 Cypress tests automatically!"

## The Reality
**Verification vs Validation.**
-   AI acts verification: "Does the page load? Yes."
-   AI fails validation: "Is this the right page? Who knows."

## The "False Positive" Flood
If you auto-generate tests based on the *current* state of the application, you are effectively **snapshotting bugs**.
-   If the "Submit" button is broken (Red), the AI writes a test expecting it to be Red.
-   When you fix it (Green), the test fails.

## Where AI Actually Helps (Synthetic Data)
Don't use AI to write tests. Use AI to generate **Test Data**.
-   "Generate 50 realistic addresses in France with edge cases (accents, long streets)."
-   "Generate a valid JSON payload for a booking with a date in the past."
**AI is a fuzzing tool, not a QA Engineer.**
