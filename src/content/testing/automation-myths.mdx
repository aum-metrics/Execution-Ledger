# Automation ROI Myths

## The "Automate Everything" Trap
A VP reads a blog post and mandates: "All tests must be automated."
**Result:** You spend $100 to automate a test that would cost $1 to run manually once a year.

## The Law of Diminishing Returns
-   **Smoke Tests (Login, Checkout):** High ROI. Run on every commit.
-   **Regression Suite:** Medium ROI. Run nightly.
-   **Corner Cases (IE11 + Zoom to 200%):** Negative ROI. Automating this takes 3 days and breaks every week.

## Automated != Maintained
Code is liability. Test code is **double liability**.
-   Every automated test requires maintenance when the UI changes.
-   If you have 2,000 UI tests, you need 2 Full-Time Engineers just to keep the suite green.

## The 80/20 Rule
Automate the **Critical Path** (80% of usage / 20% of flows).
Leave the rest to:
1.  **Manual Exploratory Testing:** Humans find "weird" bugs. Scripts only find "expected" bugs.
2.  **Bug Bounties:** Cheaper than internal QA for security.
