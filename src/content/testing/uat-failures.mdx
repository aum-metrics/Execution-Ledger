# UAT: Where Requirements Go to Die

## The "Contract vs Reality" Gap
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the moment of truth.
-   **Developers:** "It matches the Design Tool and the Issue Tracker."
-   **User:** "I hate it."

## Why UAT Fails
1.  **The "Happy Path" Bias:** PMs design for the perfect user. Real users are messy, distracted, and use Excel for everything.
2.  **Latency:** Devs test on localhost (0ms). Users are on 4G (100ms). The app feels "sluggish."
3.  **Data Density:** Devs test with 5 items. Users have 50,000 items. The scrollbar breaks.

## The Fix: Continuous UAT
Don't save UAT for "Week 12".
**Put the user in the build loop.**
-   Feature Flags.
-   Beta Groups.
-   "Can you try this screen for 5 minutes?"
**Validation is not a phase; it's a habit.**
