# Testing & Quality

Quality is an architectural constraint, not a phase at the end.

## Realities
- **[The Test Pyramid](/testing/test-pyramid)**: Why "End-to-End" tests are a maintenance trap.
- **[Shift Left](/testing/shift-left)**: Moving discovery earlier, not just running tests earlier.
- **[Manual Reality](/testing/manual-reality)**: Why automation will never replace curious humans.
