# Observability

Monitoring tells you the site is down. Observability tells you why.

## Concepts
- **[The Three Pillars](/observability/pillars)**: Logs, Metrics, Traces.
- **[Alert Fatigue](/observability/alert-fatigue)**: When everything is urgent, nothing is.
- **[Vanity Dashboards](/observability/vanity-dashboards)**: Charts that look good but say nothing.
