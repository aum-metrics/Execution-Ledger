# Software Execution Models

There is no "One True Way" to build software. The model you choose determines the problems you will face.

## The Models
- **[Waterfall](/execution-models/waterfall)**: The default for physical engineering, often misused for software.
- **[Agile](/execution-models/agile)**: The dominant religion, often reduced to "micro-management with standups".
- **[Hybrid](/execution-models/hybrid)**: The reality for 90% of enterprises.
- **[V-Model](/execution-models/v-model)**: Essential for safety-critical systems (Auto, MedTech).

## How to Choose
Do not choose based on what is trendy. Choose based on your **Cost of Failure**.
