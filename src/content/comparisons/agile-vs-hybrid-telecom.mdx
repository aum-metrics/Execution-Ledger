# Agile vs Hybrid in Telecom

Silicon Valley startups often criticize Telecoms for being slow. But Social Media Giants doesn't have to trench fiber across the Atlantic.

## The Physical Constraint
In pure software (SaaS), the cost of deployment is zero.
In Telecom (OSS/BSS), code drives hardware.
- **Scenario**: You want to update the router firmware.
- **Agile View**: "Deploy it, if it fails, roll back."
- **Reality**: If the update bricks the router, you have to send a truck to a tower in rural Nebraska. Truck rolls cost $1,000.

## The Hybrid Survival Model
Telecoms use **Agile for the BSS** (Billing, Customer App) and **Waterfall/V-Model for the OSS** (Network implementation).

## The "Digital Transformation" Lie
Consultants sell "Full Agile Transformation" to Telcos. It always fails.
The correct approach is **Bimodal IT**:
- Mode 1 (Network Core): Stable, slow, rigorous.
- Mode 2 (Digital Overlay): Fast, experimental.
The failure happens when you try to run Mode 1 like Mode 2.
