# Centralized vs Product Teams

Every CTO oscillates between "We need efficiency" (Centralization) and "We need speed" (Product Teams).

## The Cycle of Pain
1.  **Phase 1 (Product Teams)**: "Move fast and break things." Every team builds their own Auth service.
    - *Result*: Fast speed, duplicated chaos. 5 different ways to log in.
2.  **Phase 2 (Centralization)**: "Standardization." A Platform Team is formed to build *The One True Auth*.
    - *Result*: Consistency, but the Platform Team becomes a bottleneck. Product teams wait 3 weeks for an API change.
3.  **Phase 3 (Matrix)**: "Guild/Chapter Model." Guilds and Chapters.
    - *Result*: Nobody knows who their boss is.
4.  **Repeat**.

## The Reality
You cannot solve this organizationally. You can only solve it architecturally.
- **Centralize**: Infrastructure (Cloud, Networking, Security). Things that *must* be consistent.
- **Decentralize**: Business Logic (Checkout, Search, Inventory). Things that *must* move fast.
