# Fixed Bid vs Capacity

The biggest lie in software is "Fixed Price, Fixed Scope, Fixed Time, High Quality." Pick three (actually, pick two).

## The Fixed Bid Trap
**Client**: "I want to pay $100k for this app."
**Vendor**: "Okay."
**Reality**:
- Halfway through, the requirements change.
- Vendor runs out of budget.
- **Result**: The vendor cuts corners. They stop writing tests. They use copy-paste code. They assign junior devs.
- **End State**: You get feature-complete garbage that is unmaintainable.

## The Capacity Model (T&M)
**Client**: "I will pay for a team of 5 experts."
**Vendor**: "Okay."
**Reality**:
- Incentives align. The team wants to keep the client happy to keep the contract.
- Quality remains high because they have to live with the code next month.
- **Risk**: The client must perform **Strong Product Management** to ensure the team isn't just burning cash.
