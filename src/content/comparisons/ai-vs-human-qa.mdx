# AI vs Human QA

We are promised "Autonomous Testing Agents" that explore the app like a user.

## The Capability Gap
- **AI (LLM Agents)**: Excellent at following instructions ("Click the blue button") and detecting text anomalies.
- **Human**: Excellent at detecting **"This feels wrong."**

## The "Uncanny Valley" of Bugs
AI will miss the most damaging bugs:
1.  **Lag**: The app works, but it feels sluggish. AI sees `<200 OK>`, Human feels annoyance.
2.  **Context**: The "Delete Account" button is green. AI sees a valid button. Human sees a confusing UX pattern (Dark Pattern).
3.  **Visual Glitch**: The text is overlapping the image, but readable. OCR reads it fine. Human sees broken polish.

## The Future Role
QA is not dead. "Scripting Manual Test Cases" is dead.
The QA of 2026 is a **Prompt Engineer for Test Agents**—orchestrating swarms of bots to do the boring checks, while they focus on exploratory destruction.
