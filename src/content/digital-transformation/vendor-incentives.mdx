# Vendor Incentives

Understanding the economic model of your System Integrator (SI) or SaaS vendor explains their behavior.

## The "Land and Expand" SaaS
**Vendor Goal**: Get you hooked on a proprietary feature.
- Example: Cloud Provider Lambda.
- It's cheap and easy. But once you write 500 Lambdas, you can never leave Cloud Provider.
- **Advice**: Use standard containers (Docker/K8s) if you want negotiating power.

## The "Body Shop" SI
**Vendor Goal**: Maximize billable hours.
- If they fix the problem efficiently, they make less money.
- They are incentivized to create complexity that requires *their* maintenance.
- **Advice**: Never sign T&M contracts for maintenance. Sign Outcome-based contracts ("We pay for 99.9% uptime, you figure out how many people it takes").

## The Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)
Sales reps are paid heavily on multi-year lock-ins.
They will give you a 40% discount if you sign for 3 years.
**The Trap**: In 3 years, technology changes. You are paying for "Shelfware"—software you bought but don't use.
