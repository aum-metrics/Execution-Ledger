# Why Transformations Fail

70% of Digital Transformations fail to achieve their stated goals.

## Reason 1: The CEO's Timeline vs Reality
CEO: "We will be cloud-native by Q4."
Reality: You have 20 years of stored procedures in Oracle. You cannot move that in 2 quarters.
**Result**: Teams "Lift and Shift". They put the Oracle DB on an EC2 instance and call it "Cloud".
Cost goes UP (Cloud is expensive), Agility stays SAME.

## Reason 2: Misaligned Incentives
- **Dev Team**: Incentivized on Speed (Features shipped).
- **Ops Team**: Incentivized on Stability (Uptime).
- **Security Team**: Incentivized on Risk Avoidance (No breaches).
These goals are mutually exclusive.
Unless you change the incentives (e.g., Shared Goal: "Safe Speed"), the departments will war with each other.

## Reason 3: Replacing Staff with Consultants
You hire McKinsey/Accenture/Deloitte. They bring in smart 25-year-olds who know the theory but don't know *your* business.
They build a fancy strategy deck.
They leave.
Your staff, who were ignored, go back to doing things the old way because "This is how the billing system actually works."
