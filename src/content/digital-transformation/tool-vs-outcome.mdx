# Tool vs Outcome

"We are agile because we use Issue Tracker."
"We are DevOps because we use Jenkins."
"We are Collaborative because we use Messaging App."

## The Cargo Cult
This is **Cargo Cult Engineering**. It mimics the artifacts of successful companies without understanding the underlying mechanisms.

## Buying Capability
Vendors sell tools as "Solutions".
- Buying ServiceNow does not give you ITIL maturity. It gives you a form builder.
- Buying Datadog does not give you Observability. It gives you a bill.

## The Inverse Law of Tooling
**The more complex the tool configuration, the less actual work is getting done.**
If your Issue Tracker workflow has 15 states (Backlog -> Analyzed -> Ready -> In Dev -> Code Review -> QA -> UAT -> Done), you have built a **Bureaucracy Simulator**, not a delivery pipeline.
