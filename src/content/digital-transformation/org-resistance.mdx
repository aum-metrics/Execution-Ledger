# Organizational Resistance

When you try to change how a company works, the company fights back. This is not malice; it is survival.

## The Middle Management Clay Layer
Executives want change (Speed).
Developers want change (Modern tools).
**Middle Management** blocks change.
Why?
Because "DevOps" and "Agile" often mean **removing their job**.
- If teams are autonomous, what does the Project Manager do?
- If deployments are automated, what does the Release Manager do?

## Strategy: The "Trojan Horse"
Do not announce a "Transformation".
Announce a "Pilot Project" for a critical fiery problem.
1.  Find a project that is failing bad.
2.  Get exemption from all standard rules (Architecture review board, Change Control board).
3.  Deliver it in 3 months.
4.  **Then** announce that this is the new way of working.

> [!TIP]
> You cannot convince people with logic. You can only convince them with a working URL.
