# Legacy Gravity

Every Digital Transformation pitch deck starts with "We will migrate off the monolith."
Five years and $50M later, the monolith is still there, but now it has a REST API wrapper.

## The Physics of Code
The more data a system holds, the more gravity it exerts.
- **Data Gravity**: Applications move to where the data is. You can't put a microservice in Cloud Provider if the customer record is in a DB2 on-prem.
- **Risk Gravity**: The system that processes revenue is the system nobody wants to touch.

## The Strangler Fig Pattern Failures
Martin Fowler's "Strangler Fig" pattern (slowly replacing pieces) is the correct theory.
In practice, it fails because:
1.  **Dual Maintenance**: You have to support both systems for years.
2.  **Feature Parity Chase**: The legacy system keeps getting new features (regulatory/business critical), so the new system never catches up.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not start a transformation unless you are willing to **Stop All Feature Work** on the legacy system. Most executives are not brave enough to do this.
