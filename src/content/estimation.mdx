# Estimation & Planning

Estimates are probabilities, not promises. Yet, businesses treat them as contracts.

## Key Concepts
- **[Story Points](/estimation/story-points)**: A relative measure often abused as a velocity quota.
- **[Function Points](/estimation/function-points)**: An older, more rigorous, but expensive method.
- **[Fixed Bid vs Capacity](/estimation/fixed-vs-capacity)**: The contract structure dictates the outcome more than the code.
