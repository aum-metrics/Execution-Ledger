# Human in the Loop (HITL)

Until AGI arrives, critical decisions require a human signature.
But HITL strategies are often designed poorly.

## The "Rubber Stamp" Problem
If the AI is right 99% of the time, the human operator stops paying attention.
They just click "Approve" "Approve" "Approve".
When the 1% fatal error comes, they click "Approve" out of muscle memory.
**Fix**: Inject "Gold Standard" fake bad cases into the queue to keep the human awake. If they approve a fake bad case, lock their account and retrain.

## Workflow Design
- **Low Confidence**: Send to Human Queue.
- **High Confidence**: Auto-execute (but sample 5% for audit).
- **Disagreement**: If Human rejects AI, feed that data back into the retraining set immediately. This is your "Data Flywheel".

## The Reviewer UI
Don't just show the output. Show the **reasoning/citation**.
The human needs to verify the *source*, not just the summary.
