# Copilot Reality

Code Repository Copilot and similar tools are force multipliers, but they multiply **everything**—both good code and bad patterns.

## The "Autoconplete" Trap
Developers often accept the first suggestion because it "looks right."
**Reality Check**:
- It hallucinates libraries that don't exist.
- It uses deprecated APIs from its training data cutoff (2021/2023).
- It introduces subtle security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS) because it learned from bad StackOverflow answers.

## Where It Shines
- **Boilerplate**: "Write a React component with these props."
- **Regex**: "Write a regex for email validation." (Please verify it though).
- **Unit Tests**: "Write tests for this function." (It's surprisingly good at finding edge cases).

## The Senior Dev's New Role
The role of a Senior Developer has shifted from **Code Author** to **Code Reviewer**.
You are now reviewing code written by an enthusiastic intern who never sleeps but often hallucinates.
If you stop reading the code because an AI wrote it, you are dead.
