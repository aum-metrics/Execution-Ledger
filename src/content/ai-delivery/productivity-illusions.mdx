# Productivity Illusions

"We implemented Copilot and developers are writing 40% more code!"
**This is a disaster, not a victory.**

## The Code Volume Fallacy
Code is cost.
More code = More bugs = More maintenance = More upgrade pain.
If you generate 40% more code, you have increased your **Future Liability** by 40%.

## The Debugging Bottleneck
It takes 10x longer to read and debug code than to write it.
By flooding the codebase with AI-generated boilerplate, we are DDoSing our own reviewers.
PR review times skyrocket. Merge conflicts increase.

## Measuring Real Velocity
Stop measuring: Lines of Code, Commit Frequency.
Start measuring:
- **Cycle Time**: Idea to Production.
- **Change Failure Rate**: How often do we roll back?
- **Customer Value**: Did anyone use the feature?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The goal of AI should be to **Simplify** solutions (write less code), not to generate complexity faster.
