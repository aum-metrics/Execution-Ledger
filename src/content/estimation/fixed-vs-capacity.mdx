# Fixed Bid vs Capacity: The Contract TrapBid (Fixed Price)
**"I want this car for $20k."**
-   **Pros:** Cost certainty (for the client).
-   **Cons:** The vendor is incentivized to do the **minimum viable work**.
-   **Result:** The Change Request (CR) War. Every clarification becomes a billable event. The relationship becomes adversarial.

## The Capacity Model (Team Augmentation / T&M)
**"I will pay for a team of 5 experts for 6 months."**
-   **Pros:** Flexibility. You can pivot strategy in Week 2.
-   **Cons:** Cost uncertainty. "What if they deliver nothing?"

## The Outcome Based Model (The Unicorn)
**"I will pay you $1M if you increase conversion by 10%."**
-   **Reality:** This model is rare because it requires high trust. Vendors avoid the risk; Clients avoid the value-sharing.

## The Consultant's Advice
**Avoid Fixed Bid for Innovation.**
-   Fixed Bid is optimal for **Commodities** (Building a shed, installing Legacy ERP).
-   Capacity is optimal for **Discovery** (Building a new product).
-   If you sign a Fixed Bid for a new product, you are purchasing a contractual dispute, not software.
