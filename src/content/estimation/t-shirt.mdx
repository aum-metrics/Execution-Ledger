# T-Shirt Sizing: The Executive Standard

## The Cone of Uncertainty
At the start of a project, your estimation error margin is **400%**.
Trying to say "This will take 142 hours" is not science; it's a guess.

## S/M/L/XL Logic
The human brain is terrible at absolute estimation ("14 hours") but excellent at **Relative Sizing** ("This rock is twice as heavy as that rock").

| Size | Meaning | Timeline Proxy | Management Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S** | "I know exactly how to do this." | Days | "Just do it." |
| **M** | "I need to look up a few things." | Weeks | "Put it in the roadmap." |
| **L** | "We need a design spike first." | Months | "We need budget approval." |
| **XL** | "This is a new product." | Quarters | "This is a strategic initiative." |

## The "No Estimates" Movement
T-Shirt sizing is the gateway drug to **#NoEstimates**.
If you break all work down until it fits into a "Small", you stop needing to estimate. You just measure **flow**.

## The Trap
**Don't map Sizes to Hours.**
If you say "Small = 8 hours", you have just reinvented bad time-tracking.
Keep it abstract. Keep it relative.
