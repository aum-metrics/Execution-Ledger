# Story Points: Understanding the Challenges

## The Common Misconception
"Velocity" sounds precise and scientific. However, **Agile Velocity often reflects the team's confidence level** rather than absolute output. It's a relative measure that works best when used for internal planning, not external comparisons.

## The Point Inflation Pattern
**Sprint 1:** "Login Screen" = 5 Points.
**Sprint 10:** "Fix Typo" = 5 Points.

Why does this happen?
1.  **Pressure for Improvement:** Teams face expectations to show "Higher Velocity".
2.  **Goodhart's Law:** "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
3.  **Natural Drift:** As teams gain experience, their baseline for complexity shifts.

## The " Ron Jeffries" Apology
Ron Jeffries, one of the creators of XP (and points), has famously apologized:
> "I may have invented story points, and if I did, I’m sorry now."

## A Better Approach: Throughput
Consider counting **completed items** instead of points.
-   **Little's Law:** `WIP = Throughput × Cycle Time`
-   To improve flow, focus on **reducing work in progress** rather than perfecting estimates.

### Example from Indian IT Services
Many teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad have found success tracking "features shipped per sprint" rather than velocity points. This provides clearer communication with stakeholders.

## Practical Recommendation
Consider using **Cycle Time Scatterplots** instead of velocity charts in stakeholder meetings.
-   "Features typically take 8 days from start to deployment" → Clear and actionable
-   "We completed 40 points last sprint" → Requires context and explanation
