# Story Points: The Inflationary Currency

## The Lie We Tell Executives
"Velocity" sounds like physics. It implies speed and direction.
In reality, **Agile Velocity is a sentiment analysis of the team's confidence**, not a measure of output.

## The Inflation Spiral
**Sprint 1:** "Login Screen" = 5 Points.
**Sprint 10:** "Fix Typo" = 5 Points.

Why does this happen?
1.  **Pressure to "Improve":** Managers demand "Higher Velocity".
2.  **The Goodhart's Law:** "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
3.  **Team Protection:** Inflating points is the easiest way to get management off your back.

## The " Ron Jeffries" Apology
Ron Jeffries, one of the creators of XP (and points), has famously apologized:
> "I may have invented story points, and if I did, I’m sorry now."

## The Alternative: Throughput
Stop counting points. Start counting **Items**.
-   **Little's Law:** `WIP = Throughput * Cycle Time`
-   If you want to go faster, do not "estimate better". **Work on fewer things at once.**

## Consultant's Decree
**Ban "Velocity Charts" in Steering Committees.**
Show **Cycle Time Scatterplots**.
-   "It takes us 8 days on average to ship a feature." -> This is actionable.
-   "We did 40 points last sprint." -> This is noise.
