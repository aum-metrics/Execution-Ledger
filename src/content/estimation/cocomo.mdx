# COCOMO: The 1981 Relic

## The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO)
In 1981, Barry Boehm analyzed 63 software projects (mostly waterfall, mainframe, DoD) and derived a formula:

`Effort = 2.4 * (KLOC)^1.05`

**Translation:** Effort is exponential to Lines of Code (KLOC).

## Why It's Dangerous Today
1.  **Code is Liability:** In 1981, more lines meant more value. In 2025, more lines mean **Tech Debt**.
2.  **SaaS & Libraries:** You can build a global e-commerce store with 0 lines of code (Shopify) or 100k lines (Custom). COCOMO would say the Custom one is "more valuable".
3.  **The 10x Engineer:** COCOMO treats all "Person Months" as fungible. It doesn't account for the fact that one Senior Engineer with Copilot can outperform 10 Juniors.

## Where It Still Lives
**Government Contracts.**
If you are bidding for a Defense contract, you might still see COCOMO requirements.
This is why government software costs $1B and doesn't work.

## The Modern Equivalent
We don't count lines. We count **Capabilites**.
-   "Can it process payments?" (Capabilities) > "Does it have 50k lines of C++?" (COCOMO).
