# Rolling Wave Planning

## The Fog of War
You cannot see 12 months into the future.
Detailed planning for Q4 in Q1 is **waste**.

## The Mechanism
1.  **Next 2 Weeks (Sprint):** **Micro-detail**. Tasks, hours, assignees.
2.  **Next 3 Months (Quarter):** **Features**. Architecture, dependencies, rough sizing.
3.  **Next 1 Year (Roadmap):** **Themes**. "Move to Cloud", "Launch Mobile App". No dates.

## Why Executives Hate It
"I need a commitment for the whole year!"
**Your Reply:** "I can give you a commitment, but it will be a guess. Do you want a guess?"

## The "Cone of Uncertainty"
Rolling Wave embraces the Cone.
-   As you get closer to the work, the variance drops.
-   You commit *only when variance is manageable*.
