# Function Point Analysis (FPA): The Lost Art

## The "Science" of Estimation

Before Agile gave us "Story Points" (which are basically feelings converted into Fibonacci numbers), there was **Function Point Analysis (ISO/IEC 20926)**.

### How It Works
You don't guess complexity. You count inputs and outputs.
1.  **External Inputs (EI):** Forms, screens, API receivers.
2.  **External Outputs (EO):** Reports, API responses.
3.  **Internal Logical Files (ILF):** Database tables, cache stores.
4.  **External Interface Files (EIF):** Reference data from other systems.

**Formula:** `FP = Count * Complexity_Weight`

## Why It Died
1.  **Too Slow:** Counting FPs takes hours. Agile moves in minutes.
2.  **Subjectivity:** Is that "Customer Table" one logical file or three (Customer, Address, Preference)?
3.  **The API Shift:** Modern microservices have 100x more "External Interfaces" than 1990s monoliths, inflating the count wildly.

## Why You Miss It
**Story Points are inflation-prone currency.**
-   Team A's "5 points" is Team B's "13 points".
-   You cannot benchmark productivity across teams.

**Function Points were the Gold Standard.**
-   "This project is 500 FPs." is a meaningful statement to a CFO.
-   "This project is 500 Story Points" implies nothing about value delivered.

## The Consultant's Take
Don't use full IFPUG standards. Use **"Lightweight FPA"**:
1.  Count **Screens** (UI).
2.  Count **API Endpoints** (Integration).
3.  Count **Tables** (Storage).

If Team A delivers 5 Screens per sprint and Team B delivers 1, no amount of "Story Point" math can hide the productivity gap.
