# AI-Based Estimation: The Future?

## The Promise
Feed your Issue Tracker history and Git logs into an AI. It analyzes your "Cycle Time" distribution and predicts:
*"Feature X has a 85% probability of shipping in 14 days."*

## The Reality
**AI predicts the past.**
-   If your team has stable patterns (e.g., maintenance mode), AI estimation is **terrifyingly accurate**.
-   If you are building something new (Innovation), AI is **useless**. It has no training data for "Unknown Unknowns".

## Tools in the Market
1.  **LinearB / Haystack:** Analyze cycle time and PR throughput.
2.  **Issue Tracker Intelligence:** Summarizes tickets but rarely predicts dates accurately.
3.  **7 Geese / Monte Carlo:** Statistical simulation (not really AI, but math) is often better than AI.

## The Consultant's Take
**Use Monte Carlo Simulation, not "AI".**
-   Don't ask ChatGPT "How long will this take?".
-   Run a simulation: "Based on our last 50 tickets, what is the P95 delivery time?"
-   **Math > Magic.**
