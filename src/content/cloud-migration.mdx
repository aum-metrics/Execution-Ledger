# Cloud Migration

CIOs are promised "Agility" and "Cost Savings".
They usually get "Vendor Lock-in" and "Bill Shock".

## The 6 Rs of Migration
eCommerce Giants lists 6 strategies (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Repurchase, Retire, Retain).
**Reality**: 90% of companies choose **Rehost** (Lift and Shift) because it is the fastest. It is also the most expensive.

## Key Realities
- **[The Lift and Shift Trap](/cloud-migration/lift-and-shift)**: Why your server bill just went up 300%.
- **[FinOps Reality](/cloud-migration/finops-reality)**: You gave a credit card to every developer. What did you expect?
- **[The Multi-Cloud Myth](/cloud-migration/multi-cloud)**: You are not a Hyperscaler. You don't need to run on Cloud Provider and Cloud Provider simultaneously.
