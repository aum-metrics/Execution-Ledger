# The Lift and Shift Trap (Rehost)

"We will move to the cloud first, and optimize later."
**Narrator**: They never optimized later.

## The Economics
- **On-Prem**: You pay for **Capacity** (Peak load). You bought the server, running it at 10% or 100% costs the same (electricity).
- **Cloud**: You pay for **Usage**.
If you take a server designed for Peak Capacity and run it 24/7 in the cloud, you are paying a premium for capacity you aren't using.

## The "Cloud Native" Gap
Cloud savings only come from **Elasticity** (Turning things off).
Legacy apps don't know how to turn off. They allow stateful connections, local file storage, and hardcoded IPs.
To get savings, you must **Refactor** (rewrite code), not just move VMs.
