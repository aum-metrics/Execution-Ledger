# The Multi-Cloud Myth

"We need to be cloud-agnostic to avoid vendor lock-in."
This sounds smart. It is usually catastrophic.

## The Lowest Common Denominator
To run on both Cloud Provider and Cloud Provider, you cannot use:
- Cloud Provider Lambda (Must use generic K8s)
- DynamoDB (Must use generic Mongo/Postgres)
- Aurora (Must use generic RDS)
You strip away all the "Superpowers" of the cloud provider and treat them as dumb utility providers.
**Result**: You pay the Cloud Premium price but get Commodity Data Center value.

## The Talent Tax
You essentially need two distinct engineering teams.
- "I'm an Cloud Provider Expert."
- "I'm an Cloud Provider Expert."
Finding people who are experts in **both** networking stacks is impossible or expensive.
