# Why SAFe Failed in a Bank Despite Executive Buy-in

## The Setup
A Top-10 Global Bank wanted to compete with Fintechs. The CIO hired a Big 4 consultancy to roll out SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework). They trained 5,000 people, renamed "Project Managers" to "Scrum Masters", and launched "Release Trains".

## What Went Wrong
1.  **Semantic Agile**: The teams were doing standups, but deployments were still tied to a quarterly release window on the mainframe.
2.  **Dependency Gridlock**: PI Planning (Program Increment) revealed that every "feature" depended on the same 3 Shared Services teams (Security, Identity, Database), which were not part of the trains.
3.  **The "Watermelon" Status**: Dashboards were Green (On Track) because teams marked "Story Completed" when code was written, not deployed. Real status was Red.

## Early Warning Signs
- **Proxy Product Owners**: The real business owners were too busy to attend meetings, so they sent delegates who couldn't make decisions.
- **Hardening Sprints**: They added a 2-week "Stabilization" sprint at the end of every PI. This is just disguised Waterfall testing.

## Decision Matrix: Anatomy of Failure

<DecisionMatrix
  data={[
    { factor: "Leadership", rating: "High", reality: "CIO was committed, but Middle Management fought to keep control." },
    { factor: "Tooling", rating: "Extreme", reality: "Issue Tracker became a compliance tool, not a work management tool." },
    { factor: "Impact", rating: "Very Slow", reality: "Release cadence went from 4/year to... 4/year." },

## What Winners Did Differently
Capital One and JPMC succeeded by:
1.  **In-Sourcing Engineering**: You cannot do Agile with 80% vendors.
2.  **Cloud First**: They broke the infrastructure dependency before scaling the process.
3.  **Product Funding**: They funded **value streams**, not projects.
