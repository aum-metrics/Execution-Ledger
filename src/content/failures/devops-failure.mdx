# DevOps Without Product Ownership: A Postmortem

## The Setup
A Logistics giant decided to "do DevOps". They built a world-class Kubernetes platform, hired strict SREs, and automated every deployment. The "How" was perfect. The "What" was missing.

## What Went Wrong
1.  **The "Platform" Silo**: The Platform team built tools that the Product teams didn't understand and didn't ask for.
2.  **Ghost Products**: Developers pushed code fast, but because Product Managers weren't involved in the feedback loop, they pushed the *wrong* features fast.
3.  **On-Call Mutiny**: Developers were told "You build it, you run it", but they weren't given the authority to prioritize technical debt fix. They burned out.

## Early Warning Signs
- **Ticket Throwing**: The Platform team demanded tickets to whitelist IPs, effectively becoming a new SysAdmin silo.
- **Shadow IT**: Product teams secretly spun up Cloud Provider accounts to bypass the "Official Platform" because it was too rigid.

## Decision Matrix: Why it Stalled

<DecisionMatrix
  data={[
    { factor: "Tech Excellence", rating: "High", reality: "The Kubernetes clusters were immaculate." },
    { factor: "User Value", rating: "Low", reality: "Features didn't land any faster for the customer." },
    { factor: "Morale", rating: "Low", reality: "SREs hated the Devs; Devs hated the Platform." },
  ]}
/>

## What Winners Did Differently
Companies like Music Streaming Giants/Streaming Giants understand that **internal developer platforms (IDP)** must be treated as a product. The Platform team's metrics should be "Developer Net Promoter Score", not just "Uptime".
