# AI Productivity Gains That Vanished After 6 Months

## The Setup
A Healthcare SaaS provided Code Repository Copilot to all 200 engineers. Initial surveys showed "happiness" spikes. The CTO promised the Board a 30% increase in feature throughput.

## What Went Wrong
1.  **The Code/Review Imbalance**: Junior devs generated code 5x faster. Senior devs (Senior/Principal) spent 5x longer reviewing it because the AI code looked plausible but had subtle edge-case bugs.
2.  **Prompt Debt**: The codebase became filled with verbose, AI-style boilerplate function comments that drifted from the actual logic.
3.  **The "Learning Cliff"**: Junior devs stopped reading documentation. When the AI hallucinated an API method that didn't exist, they were stuck for days.

## Decision Matrix: The AI Trap

<DecisionMatrix
  data={[
    { factor: "Lines of Code", rating: "Extreme", reality: "Went up 40%. This is BAD. More code = more liability." },
    { factor: "Bug Density", rating: "High", reality: "Bugs per feature increased because AI doesn't understand cross-file context." },
    { factor: "Senior Burnout", rating: "High", reality: "Seniors became full-time janitors for AI-generated code." },
  ]}
/>

## What Winners Did Differently
Successful AI adopters:
1.  **Restricted AI to Boilerplate**: Used it for unit tests and types, not core business logic.
2.  **Enforced Smaller PRs**: AI encourages "Mega PRs". They forced a limit of 200 lines to ensure human reviewability.
3.  **Measuring Outcomes, Not Output**: They measured "features shipped per month", not "commits per day".
