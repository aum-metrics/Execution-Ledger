# AI-Assisted Execution

We aren't just using AI to write code. We are using it to manage the project.

## The Auto-PM
Tools that read your Messaging App messages and Code Repository PRs to auto-update Issue Tracker status.
- **Promise**: "No more status meetings!"
- **Reality**: The AI misinterprets "I'm looking into it" as "In Progress", and "I'm stuck" as "Completed" because the PR was merged (even though it was a revert PR).

## The Code-to-Cloud Gap
AI writes code instantly.
But safety checks, compliance reviews, and approvals still take humans days.
**Result**: AI increases the *Inventory* of unreleased code, creating a bottleneck at the QA/Release gate.
Increasing upstream velocity (Coding) without increasing downstream velocity (Testing/Deploying) just creates a pile-up.

> [!WARNING]
> AI solves the easy part (typing). It exacerbates the hard part (integration and consensus).
