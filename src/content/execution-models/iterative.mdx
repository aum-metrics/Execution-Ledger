# Iterative Development

Iterative development accepts that your first draft is garbage. The goal is to improve it.

## The Design Loop
1.  **Sketch**: Build a throwaway prototype.
2.  **Critique**: Put it in front of a user.
3.  **Refine**: Build the real thing based on what they actually did, not what they said they would do.

## Why Companies Fail at This
**Ego**.
Executives want to launch "Perfect" products. They view iterations as "Rework" or "Waste".
> "Why didn't you get it right the first time?"

**Answer**: Because nobody knows what "Right" is until they touch it.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Iterative vs Traditional"
  headers={["Dimension", "Traditional", "Iterative"]}
  rows={[
    ["Launch Criteria", "All Features Complete", "Core Value Usable"],
    ["Feedback Loop", "Months (Post-Launch)", "Days/Hours"],
    ["Cost Profile", "Heavy CapEx upfront", "Continuous OpEx"]

/>

## Where to Use
- **Consumer Apps**: UI/UX requires feel, not specs.
- **AI/ML Models**: You essentially train (iterate) until accuracy is acceptable.
- **Innovation Labs**: Where the problem statement itself is unclear.
