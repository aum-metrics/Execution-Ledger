# DevOps-driven Delivery

"DevOps" was supposed to break strict silos.
In most companies, it just renamed the "SysAdmin" team to "DevOps Team" and nothing changed.

## True DevOps
True DevOps is not a title; it is a workflow.
It means the developer has `kubectl` access to production (or a paved path to it) and carries the pager.
**If you don't carry the pager, you don't care about code quality.**

## The "DevOps Engineer" Paradox
Hiring a "DevOps Engineer" is an anti-pattern.
DevOps is a culture of shared responsibility.
If you have a dedicated person who "Does the Deployment", you have re-created the separation (The Wall of Confusion) that DevOps was meant to destroy.

## Elite Performers (DORA Metrics)
The only metrics that distinguish elite teams:
1.  **Lead Time for Changes**: < 1 hour.
2.  **Deployment Frequency**: On-demand.
3.  **Change Failure Rate**: < 5%.
4.  **MTTR (Recovery)**: < 1 hour.
If you measure "Lines of Code" or "Hours Worked", you are measuring vanity.
