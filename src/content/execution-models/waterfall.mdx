# Waterfall (Legacy Reality)

Everyone hates it. Yet, 90% of massive systems (Banking Core, Telecom Infrastructure, Aerospace) still rely on it. Why?

## The Truth About "Agile Fallacies"
Consultants sell Agile as a cure-all. But you cannot "iterate" a suspension bridge or a radiation therapy machine.
- **Cost of Change**: In software, moving a button is cheap. In embedded systems, reflashing 10,000 ECUs is bankruptcy.
- **Contractual Gravity**: When you sign a $500M vendor contract, the lawyers don't care about your "Sprint Goals". They care about milestones.

## When Waterfall Wins
1.  **Fixed-Price Contracts**: You cannot bid fixed-price on variable scope.
2.  **Regulatory Compliance**: FDA and FAA auditing trails are essentially Waterfall documentation deliverables.
3.  **Hardware Dependencies**: You can't deploy code to a chip that hasn't been fabricated.

> [!WARNING]
> If you try to run Agile in a Fixed-Bid/Fixed-Scope environment, you are just doing **micromanaged Waterfall** with more meetings.

## The Modern "V-Model"
Most successful hardware/software companies use the V-Model, which is just Waterfall with a testing conscience.
