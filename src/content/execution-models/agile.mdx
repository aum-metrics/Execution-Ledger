# Agile (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe)

## The Reality Check
Real Agile (The Manifesto) is rare. What exists in 90% of Fortune 500s is "Water-Scrum-Fall" or SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), which is effectively Waterfall with more meetings. True Agile requires high talent density and trust; most orgs have neither.

## Where This Works
- **SaaS Products**: Continuous deployment and feedback loops are native here.
- **Innovation Labs**: Where the goal is learning/discovery, not just output.
- **Team-Funded Models**: Where teams are long-lived and funded by capacity, not project.

## Where This Fails
- **Low-Trust Environments**: If management demands a gantt chart for the next 12 months, Agile becomes a lie where teams make up story points to fit the deadline.
- **Dependency Hell**: In highly coupled legacy architectures, one "Agile" team cannot move faster than the slowest mainframe dependency.

## Why Companies Choose It
1.  **Recruiting**: You cannot hire good engineers in 2025 if you say you do Waterfall.
2.  **Market Pressure**: The need to release "something" every 2 weeks to show stakeholders momentum.

## Why Companies Regret It
They regret it when they realize **Agile exposes dysfunction, it doesn't fix it.** Without engineering excellence (CI/CD, auto-testing), Agile just means you ship bugs faster.

## The "SAFe" Trap
SAFe is often chosen by executives who want to *say* they are Agile without changing the command-and-control hierarchy. It adds layers that abstract the engineers further from the customer.

    { factor: "Transparency", rating: "High", reality: "Everyone knows exactly what isn't working immediately." },
