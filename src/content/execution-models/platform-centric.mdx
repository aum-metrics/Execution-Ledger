# Platform-Centric Delivery

The most mature organizations (Search Giants, Streaming Giants, eCommerce Giants) don't build "Applications". They build **Platforms** that enable autonomous teams to ship applications.

## The Internal Developer Platform (IDP)
Your goal is to reduce the "Cognitive Load" on stream-aligned teams.
- **Before**: Dev needs to know Cloud Provider, K8s, Terraform, Jenkins, Security Groups.
- **After**: Dev runs `npx create-service`, and the Platform handles the plumbing.

## The Failure Mode: The "Platform Silo"
We see this constantly:
1.  Company creates a "Platform Team".
2.  Platform Team goes into a cave for 12 months to build "The Perfect Kubernetes Abstraction".
3.  They launch it.
4.  **Nobody uses it** because it solves problems nobody had, and ignores the problems they actually have.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Treat the Platform as a **Product**. Your developers are your **Customers**. If they don't buy (adopt) it voluntarily, your product failed. DO NOT MANDATE ADOPTION.

## Evolution of a Platform
1.  **Wiki-Based**: "Run these 50 commands."
2.  **Script-Based**: "Run this `./deploy.sh`."
3.  **Service-Based**: "Call this PI via Backstage."
4.  **Invisible**: "Push to git, and we handle the rest."
