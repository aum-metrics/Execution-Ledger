# Incremental Model

Incremental means delivering finished slices of value.

## Iterative vs Incremental
- **Iterative**: Sketching the whole painting, then coloring it in. (Refining quality)
- **Incremental**: Painting the left corner fully, then the center. (Adding scope)

## The Trap
The biggest risk in Incremental delivery is **Frankenstein Architecture**.
If you build the "Payments" room without thinking about the "User Profile" room, your hallway (Database) will be a mess.

> [!TIP]
> You need a "Walking Skeleton" architecture—a thin slice of end-to-end functionality—before you start incremental delivery.

## Execution Reality
Most "Agile" teams are actually doing **Incremental Waterfall**.
- Sprint 1: Login
- Sprint 2: Profile
- Sprint 3: Dashboard
This is just a breakdown of a requirements document into 2-week chunks. It is *not* iterative, because they never revisit the Login feature.
