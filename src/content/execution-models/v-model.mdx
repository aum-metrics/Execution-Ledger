# V-Model

The V-Model connects **Requirements** directly to **Validation** at every level. It is the gold standard for Automotive, Medical, and Aerospace.

## Structure
- **Left Side (Design)**: Requirements → Arch → Detailed Design
- **Right Side (Verification)**: UAT ← System Test ← Unit Test

## Why It Matters
In a typical SaaS startup, if you ship a bug, you revert.
In a pacemaker, if you ship a bug, you cause critical failure.

## Common Mistakes
1.  **Paperwork Over Process**: Generating documents just for the audit, not for engineering value.
2.  **Late Integration**: Waiting until the very end of the 'V' to plug the cable in. (Hint: It never works).
