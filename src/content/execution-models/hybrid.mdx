# Hybrid Execution Models

"Water-Scrum-Fall". "Wagile". Purists mock it.
But it is the **only** way to interface a high-speed digital team with a slow-speed corporate backend.

## The Interface Design
Imagine a Mobile App Team (Agile, 2-week sprints) talking to a Mainframe Team (Waterfall, 6-month releases).
How do they sync?

### Pattern 1: The Simulator (Good)
The Mobile team builds a "Mock Mainframe" that simulates the API.
They run fast against the mock.
They suffer a "Integration Hell" week when the real Mainframe is finally ready.

### Pattern 2: The Blockage (Bad)
The Mobile team sits on their hands waiting for the Mainframe team.
This creates "Inventory Waste"—code that is written but undeployable.

## The Governance Layer
The Hybrid model adds a translation layer.
- **Agile Team**: Reports Velocity / Burn-down.
- **PMO Wrapper**: Converts "Story Points" into "% Complete" for the Steering Committee.
It is an administrative tax, but it keeps the funding flowing.
