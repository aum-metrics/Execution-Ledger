# Why Engineers Ignore Alerts

You spent $200k on Datadog/NewRelic.
Your engineers created 500 alerts.
Now, they have created an email rule to auto-archive all alerts.

## The Signal-to-Noise Ratio
If I get woken up at 3 AM for a "Low Disk Space" warning on a temp folder, and I do nothing and go back to sleep...
I have trained my brain that **PagerDuty = Annoyance**, not **Danger**.

## Flappy Alerts
An alert that fires, resolves itself in 2 minutes, and fires again 10 minutes later.
This is psychological torture.
**Fix**: Implement "Hysteresis" (Must be broken for >5 minutes to alert) or "Holt-Winters" prediction (Anomaly detection) rather than static thresholds.

## No Runbooks
An alert fires: "Error Code 5432".
The engineer stares at it. "What does that mean?"
Every alert MUST link to a specific Playbook:
1.  What impact does this have?
2.  How to verify it?
3.  How to mitigate (restart X, rollback Y)?
If you don't know the playbook, do not create the alert. Log it instead.
