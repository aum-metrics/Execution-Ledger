# Alert Fatigue

Sunday, 3:00 AM. PagerDuty fires.
"CPU usage > 80% on worker-node-45."
You wake up, check the graph. It dropped back to 70%. You go back to sleep.

## The Boy Who Cried Wolf
This is the most dangerous state for an operations team.
When 90% of alerts are "noise" or "self-healing", the operator ignores the 10% that are real signals of catastrophic failure.

## The Rule of Actionable Alerts
Every alert must meet criteria:
1.  **Is a user affected?** (If CPU is 90% but Latency is 20ms, nobody cares. Do not alert).
2.  **Is human intervention required?** (If the auto-scaler handles it, do not alert).
3.  **Do I know what to do?** (An alert saying "Unknown Error" usually just stresses people out).
