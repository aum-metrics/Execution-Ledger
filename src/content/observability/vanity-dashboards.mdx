# Vanity Dashboards

We love big screens in the NOC (Network Operations Center) with spinning globes, green pie charts, and "Total Requests Served: 10,000,000".

## What they hide
These dashboards act as **Success Theater**.
- "99.9% Uptime" (But the checkout button is broken for Safari users).
- "Average Latency: 200ms" (But the P99 latency is 10 seconds, meaning 1% of users are timing out).

## The only metric that matters
**Business/User Impact.**
- "Orders per minute" (If this drops to zero, wake everyone up).
- "Login Success Rate".
- "Payment Gateway Rejections".

> [!CAUTION]
> Stop building dashboards for your boss. Build dashboards for the person debugging the outage at 2 AM. They don't need a spinning globe; they need log aggregation.

## Observability Maturity
1.  **Monitoring**: "Something is broken."
2.  **Observability**: "I know WHY it is broken."
3.  **Causality**: "I know what changed to make it break."
