# The Three Pillars

The marketing brochure says you need Logs, Metrics, and Traces to have "Observability".

## 1. Metrics (The "What")
- **Aggregates**. Low cardinality. fast.
- "CPU is high." "Error rate is 5%."
- **Problem**: You lose the detail. You see the spike, but not the user who caused it.

## 2. Logs (The "Why" Context)
- **Events**. High volume. expensive.
- "User 123 failed login with Exception X."
- **Problem**: Too much noise. Searching "Exception" returns 50,000 hits.

## 3. Traces (The "Where")
- **Requests**. The path through microservices.
- "Service A called Service B which timed out."
- **Problem**: Sampling. You usually only capture 1% of traces because keeping 100% is too expensive.

## The Missing Pillar: Correlation
Having these 3 in separate tools (Splunk for logs, Datadog for metrics, Jaeger for traces) is **useless**.
Real Observability is the ability to click a spike in the Metric, see the Trace for that spike, and read the Logs for that trace ID.
**Context is King.**
