# What Leadership Needs to See

Engineers show dashboards with CPU graphs.
Leaders want to see **Money Flow**.

## Translation Layer
You must translate technical signals into business risk.

| Technical Metric | Business Translation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Error Rate 5%** | "5% of customers cannot checkout. We are losing $10k/hour." |
| **Latency +200ms** | "Conversion rate dropped 10% due to slowness." |
| **Disk Full** | "We cannot accept new customers after Tuesday." |

## The "Red/Green" Report
Executives want simple traffic lights.
- **Green**: On Track.
- **Yellow**: Risk, but we have a plan.
- **Red**: Blocked, I need your help/money.

> [!TIP]
> Never report "Green" if there is a risk. Leaders hate surprises. They prefer a "Yellow" today over a "Red" on launch day.
